## Short story :  
I started hacking at 13 yr old and started with learning the fundamentals of networking/python.
Then move my way to the bug bounty (after studying for months the web hacking methodology from online resources) After weeks of hard work I've managed to get my first bounty , xss for 500$ then after more months I got some other bugs . Unfortunately I had to quit bug bounty because of school :( . But I am 100% at  that time I was in top 3 youngest bug hunters in the world.  
Well after finishing my 8th grade exam I found https://blackarch.org/'s discord server (https://discord.gg/nhjSNnZ5)  the guys there helped me to grow my skills even further.  
In the 9th grade I started CTFs and shortly after joined the C0DWER team , I am not really the best there since my CTF skills where always not very good but I am improving every day.
