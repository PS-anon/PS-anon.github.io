*Part still in development*



## Who I am(as PS)  
I am a normal skid who spends most of his time on the internet between  developing tools, listening to music, trolling, hacking, shitposting, spamming and playing chess    

## Who I am(as Adrian)
Although Adrian and PS may seem to be the same person, THEY ARE NOT , PS represents the internet side of Adrian , while the real life guy is, well, me :))  
Adrian is a guy from .ro who strangely enjoys running(for someone that sits at a desk > 6h/day), he likes the color light blue, has a long black hair(usually keeps it in a pony tail), brown-greenish eyes, and is 16 yr old.  
I prefer sweets and hot chocolate I am not really a soda/coffe guy, weird stuff about Adrian : he likes rainy days and prefers evening over morning what a weird guy.  
Adrian(in the future) wants to become a CEO at a company/own a business and move to USA/Canada(it was one of my childhood dreams to move out of this country and go to USA/Canada), he works hard to accomplish that goal. Having many ideas is hard to focus on just on of them so he has to split the time between his cyber security passion and creating websites/bringing his ideas to life.  
He also owns some dogs(we will discuss about them later)  

## About PS's cyber security life  
PS started to work on cyber security at the age of 13 when he got bored of coding  
He started with simple things and worked his was up to bug bounty , where he started making some money(I will release one day a blog post on how to get started on bug bounty) I am 100% that at the time I started bb I was in the top 3 yougest hunters, after some time , PS had to quit bug bounty because of school , he was really behind stuff there and I was putting to much work on bug bounty , after finishing the school stuff and getting big grades I returned to cyber security.  
There PS started on learning CTFs, I was never good at CTFs mostly because of the mentality that the app is already vuln to something and your creativity goes mostly on a limited scale , which is cool but I much prefer the bug bounty mentality, is just you and the app, a hole app not just a part of it.  
Shortly after starting CTFs I was lucky enough to join the CODWER team , which is one of the best teams :D , I feel that my skills had greatly improved in a really shot period of time.  
Let's not forget about Hackthebox where you have to hack machines , which is cool too , but still the CTF style XD.  

## The nickname PS
I am asked a lot, what does PS means, well PS has a lot of meanings and can be anything you want, I have this nickname since I joined the IRC servers :)).  
I like it because is short and easy to remember, also *WE ARE PS*  

## What music does PS listen to 
PS listens to rap/jazz  
Rap keeps me alive and jazz keeps me calm, focus and relaxed.  
I do have a favourite artist, is G-Eazy, he has some really nice songs, I especially like the album "Everything is strange here", but I listen to other rappers too : Drake, 2Pac, Biggie, Polo G, Da Baby, N.W.A., 50 Cent ...  
Fav song : G-Eazy Every Night Of The Year  
I do not really have a fav jazz artist, I mostly liten to a random playlist.

## Husky Owner 
Another childhood dream was to own a Husky , which I do now :)  
You may know him as Tor(not Thor), and yes is the dog in the above picture :D  
Some details about him :  
Hacker name(nickname) : HeckaTor  
Loves : eating, walking, hacking cats  
Hates : Any other animal that is not a husky  =)) trust me here   
Passion : Dragging so hard on that god dammed leash while walk and stalking neighbours =)))  
Age : 1 year and 6 months  
Eye color : one blue and one brown

He is a pro hacking companion  

## My setup   
You may wonder what I use to hack you  

I have an macbook pro mid 2018 with Big Sur  
VMs :
